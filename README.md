<!--todo--- Things we will need to do for javascript functionality
    
    1.
     On click of submit in search bar we will need to grab value of search bar and use that value to submit for request to the API.

    2. 
    Cards will need to populate with img and name of certain foods that pertain to what ever ingredient searched grabbed from AJAX

    3. 
    An event listener will need to be on the cards for when they are clicked to open up a hidden div that will be dynamically populated with information from the API. 

    4. 
    There will need to be event listeners on this page for a close button and an add button, close will close the page and return to the cards, add will add the recipe to the recipe book

    5. 
    Like weather app, page will only change when a new item is searched or an item from the recipe book is selected

        - on click of recipe book item there will be an event listener for the same function that (3) does. 


        - there should also be an event listener for an X that will delete an item from recipe book AKA delete from local storage 

    6. Local Storage will store information in the recipe book



    GORDON RAMSAY FEELING LUCKY BUTTON

    1. Event listener for click 

    2. The click will call the API and give six random Recipes from the API I believe we can use Math.Random and it should be pretty easy 

    3. If we have time and its easy we should add an audio file saying "what are you an Idiot sandwich?!" everytime you click the button 

    4. After the initial click, the same functions listed above will be done.-->
